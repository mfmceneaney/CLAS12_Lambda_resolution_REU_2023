# CLAS12_Lambda_resolution_REU_2023

This is the work I did as part of the Duke / TUNL 2023 REU program in Nuclear Physics. My goal was to improve the resolution of lambdas at CLAS12 by implementing a neural network. While the results are not immediate improvements, with more training data this model could likely be used to improve the lambda resolution.
